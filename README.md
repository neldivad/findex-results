### Note (Nov 2021):
It has come to my attention that the results for males and females seem to be inconsistent. I have probably made a mistake at interpreting females as males, and vice versa. This is because the `female` column is classified as either 1 or 2, and I assumed a `female == 1` would mean the subject is a female, which may be the other way around.

If you can prove to me which value corresponds to the true gender, write an email to me and I will confirm the facts in this section, though I will not update the results you're seeing here as it is going to take too much time.

I'll appreciate all the help you've contributed.
